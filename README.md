# 🎓 Admission Cell Slot Booking System
 This project is a Django-based Slot Booking System that allows users to dynamically book available slots with teachers. It ensures users can book only one slot per day, prevents past slot bookings, and sends confirmation emails upon successful booking.
It uses **Django** for the backend and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend. This system facilitates streamlined slot management for **students**, **teachers**, and **admins** during admission counseling sessions.
